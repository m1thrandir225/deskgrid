# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this app is

DeskGrid is a desk-booking / hot-desking app. Domain hierarchy: `Office` → `Floor` → `Desk` → `Reservation`, owned by a `User`. Admins manage offices, floors, desks, and employees; employees reserve desks for specific dates. A waitlist (`ReservationNotification`) lets employees ask to be notified when a desk frees up.

Stack: Laravel 13 (PHP 8.4/8.5) + Inertia.js v3 + React 19 + TypeScript, Tailwind v4, shadcn/Radix UI components, running under Laravel Sail (Docker).

## Commands

All PHP/Composer/Artisan commands run through Sail — see the Sail rules above (`vendor/bin/sail ...`).

- Start environment: `vendor/bin/sail up -d`
- Run everything (server + queue + logs + vite) at once: `vendor/bin/sail composer run dev` (or `composer dev` inside the container) — runs `artisan serve`, `artisan queue:listen`, `artisan pail`, and `npm run dev` concurrently.
- Frontend dev server only: `vendor/bin/sail pnpm run dev`
- Frontend build: `vendor/bin/sail pnpm run build` (add `build:ssr` to also build `resources/js/ssr.jsx`)
- Lint JS/TS: `vendor/bin/sail pnpm run lint`
- Format JS/TS: `vendor/bin/sail pnpm run format` (check-only: `format:check`)
- PHP style: `vendor/bin/sail bin pint --dirty --format agent` (see Pint rules above)
- Run full test suite: `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact`
- Run a single test: `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --filter=testName` or pass a file path; Pest directly via `vendor/bin/sail bin pest`

Tests use Pest, live in `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit`, and run against `DB_DATABASE=testing` with array/sync drivers for cache/session/queue/mail (see `phpunit.xml`).

## Architecture

### Domain & data model (`app/Models`, `app/Enums`)

- `Office` (belongs to a `User` as owner) → `Floor` (has a `plan_image`) → `Desk` (has `x_position`/`y_position` for placement on the floor plan, `is_active`) → `Reservation` (belongs to `Desk` and `User`, scoped to one `reservation_date`, status via `ReservationStatus` enum).
- `User.role` (`UserRole` enum: Admin/Employee) drives authorization — `AdminMiddleware` (route middleware alias `admin`) hard-gates admin-only routes (office/floor/desk/employee CRUD); `app/Policies/*` handle per-model authorization within controllers.
- `ReservationNotification` implements a per-desk/per-date waitlist: `Desk::isCurrentlyReserved()` / `ReservationNotification::getPendingForDeskAndDate()` back the "notify me" flow. Cancelling a reservation dispatches `SendReservationCancelledNotifications` (queued job) which emails waitlisted users in order and marks them notified.

### Caching

Model `booted()` hooks (`Office`, `Reservation`) call into `App\Services\CacheInvalidationService` on save/delete to invalidate a set of hand-built cache keys (`office_floors_{id}`, `desk_availability_{deskId}_{date}`, `dashboard_stats_{userId}`, etc.) plus a `office_{id}` cache tag. When adding a new cached read path or a new field that affects availability/dashboard data, add the matching invalidation call here rather than inventing a separate ad hoc cache-clear.

### Demo mode

Controlled by `DEMO_MODE` / `config/demo.php`. `DemoUserServiceProvider` seeds a fixed demo admin/employee and a "Demo Office" with two floors on boot when enabled. `DemoRestrictions` middleware blocks registration and a hardcoded list of destructive routes (see the `$blockedRoutes` array in `app/Http/Middleware/DemoRestrictions.php`) when demo mode is on — extend that list when adding new destructive routes that should be safe to expose on the public demo.

### Inertia/React frontend (`resources/js`)

- Entry point `resources/js/app.tsx` (client) and `resources/js/ssr.jsx` (SSR build target, `bootstrap/ssr/`). Pages live in `resources/js/pages/**` mirroring route names (e.g. `offices/floors/show.tsx`); Inertia resolves them via `resolvePageComponent`.
- `HandleInertiaRequests::share()` (`app/Http/Middleware/HandleInertiaRequests.php`) is the single source of shared props: `auth.user`, `flash.message`/`flash.error` (session-flashed), and `demo` config when demo mode is active. New global frontend state should go through here, not through per-page props.
- Path alias `@/*` → `resources/js/*` (see `tsconfig.json` and `components.json`); shadcn is configured with that same alias set (`@/components`, `@/components/ui`, `@/lib`, `@/hooks`).
- `resources/js/components/floor/plan-editor/*` is the admin floor-plan editor (desk placement); `resources/js/components/floor/viewer/*` is the read-only/booking view of the same floor plan. Editor state is a Zustand store with `zundo` undo/redo (`resources/js/lib/stores/plan-editor.store.ts`), exposed via `resources/js/providers/plan-editor-provider.tsx` + `resources/js/contexts/plan-editor-context.tsx`.
- `resources/js/types/*.ts` mirror the backend models/DTOs (`Desk`, `Floor`, `Office`, `Reservation`, `Employee`) — keep these in sync when changing fillable fields or resource shapes.
- Routing helpers come from Ziggy (`route()` global, typed via `ziggy-js` path alias to `vendor/tightenco/ziggy`).

### Infra

- Local dev runs in Docker via Laravel Sail (`docker-compose.yml`): Postgres, Redis, MinIO (S3-compatible storage, used for floor plan images), Mailpit. `AWS_*` env vars point at the local MinIO instance by default.
- Laravel Nightwatch and Telescope are both present for observability/debugging; Telescope is excluded from package auto-discovery and wired manually via `TelescopeServiceProvider`.

=== foundation rules ===

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.5. You are an expert with the Laravel ecosystem. Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:
- PHP packages: run `composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `vendor/bin/sail pnpm run build`, `vendor/bin/sail pnpm run dev`, or `vendor/bin/sail composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Use `search-docs` before changes that depend on Laravel ecosystem APIs, behavior, configuration, or version-specific syntax. Skip it for copy-only edits and other changes where package documentation is irrelevant. Reuse sufficient results already in context instead of searching again.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Project Rules

- This project contains committed, area-grouped rules in `.ai/rules` when that directory exists (settled decisions, non-obvious traps, standing constraints). Framework and package guidelines that only apply to specific paths (testing, frontend, components) also live there, under `.ai/rules/boost` — this is not just recorded decisions, it is load-bearing guidance you have not seen inline. Before you enter plan mode or create/edit any file, you MUST first: open @.ai/rules/index.md (it maps file globs to rule files), read every rule file whose globs cover the path(s) in scope, and run `grep -rin 'keyword' .ai/rules` to catch what a path match alone misses. Do not write code until you have read and are following every matching rule. If `.ai/rules` does not exist, continue without it.
- Record a rule with `record-rule` only when the user explicitly asks for one. Instructions for the work at hand are not rules, no matter how emphatic: "remove this typo", "use X here" are work to do, not rules to record. Never record a rule on your own initiative, as a byproduct of a change, or to summarize what you just did. When the user does ask, pass a `glob` (e.g. `app/Http/Controllers/**`), a short `title`, and a few-line `note`. Use `record-rule` rather than your native memory or notes tool, because native memory is personal and session-scoped, while only `.ai/rules` is shared with the team and persists in the repo.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `vendor/bin/sail artisan route:list`). Use `vendor/bin/sail artisan list` to discover available commands and `vendor/bin/sail artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `vendor/bin/sail artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `vendor/bin/sail artisan config:show app.name`, `vendor/bin/sail artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `vendor/bin/sail artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `vendor/bin/sail artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.
- Activate the `deploying-to-cloud` skill whenever deploying to Laravel Cloud, configuring Cloud environments or resources, using the Cloud CLI, or troubleshooting Cloud deployments.

=== sail rules ===

# Laravel Sail

- This project runs inside Laravel Sail's Docker containers. You MUST execute all commands through Sail.
- Start services using `vendor/bin/sail up -d` and stop them with `vendor/bin/sail stop`.
- Open the application in the browser by running `vendor/bin/sail open`.
- Always prefix PHP, Artisan, Composer, and Node commands with `vendor/bin/sail`. Examples:
    - Run Artisan Commands: `vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate`
    - Install Composer packages: `vendor/bin/sail composer install`
    - Execute Node commands: `vendor/bin/sail pnpm run dev`
    - Execute PHP scripts: `vendor/bin/sail php [script]`
- View all available Sail commands by running `vendor/bin/sail` without arguments.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Add or update tests for behavior and logic changes when a test provides meaningful regression coverage.
- Pure copy, styling, and layout-only changes do not require new or updated tests.
- When test coverage applies, run the affected tests and ensure they pass.
- Test the changed behavior and its important failure modes, but do not add tests beyond them.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill for guidance on coverage, naming, structure, dependency isolation, and review.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia client-side patterns.

# Inertia v2

- Use all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New features: deferred props, infinite scroll, merging props, polling, prefetching, once props, flash data.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `vendor/bin/sail artisan list` and check their parameters with `vendor/bin/sail artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `vendor/bin/sail pnpm run build` or ask the user to run `vendor/bin/sail pnpm run dev` or `vendor/bin/sail composer run dev`.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/sail bin pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/sail bin pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/sail bin pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

# Pest

- This project uses Pest. Create tests with `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Do not include the test suite directory in `{name}`. Use `SomeFeatureTest`, not `Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill for guidance on coverage, naming, structure, dependency isolation, and review.
- Do not delete tests or test files without approval. They are part of the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the narrowest set of tests that covers the change. Pass a file path or `--filter=testName` to `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact`.
- Rerun a test after each change to it.
- Run `vendor/bin/sail bin pest` to call the test runner directly. It accepts the same file path and `--filter=testName` arguments.
- After the feature tests pass, ask the user to run the complete suite with `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact`.

=== inertia-react/core rules ===

# Inertia + React

- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia React client-side patterns.
